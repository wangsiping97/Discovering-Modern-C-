## 1.4 Expressions and Statements

### 1.4.2 Statements

Recent compilers optimize out useless computations (e.g. `y+z;`). However, it is not guaranteed that this statement can always be omitted. If y or z is an object of a user type, then the addition is also user defined and might change y or z or something else. This is obviously bad programming style but legitimate in C++. 

### 1.4.3 Branching

#### If-Statement

C++17 The if-statement was extended in C++17 with the possibility to initialize a variable whose scope is limited to the if-statement. 

```c++
// res could have been declared before the if-statement
map <string, double> constants= {{"e", 2.7}, {"pi", 3.14}};
if (auto res = constants.insert({"h", 6.6e-34}); res.second)
    cout ≪ "inserted" ≪ res.first->first ≪ " mapping to "
         ≪ res.first->second ≪ endl;
else
		cout ≪ "entry for " ≪ res.first->first ≪ " already exists.\n";
```

#### Switch Statement

C++17 To avoid warnings of omitting `break` in the switch statement and to communicate to co-developers that the fall-through is intended, C++17 introduces the attribute `[[fallthrough]]`.

```c++
switch(op_code) {
  case 0: z= x + y; break;
  case 1: z= x - y; cout ≪ "compute diff\n"; break;
  case 2: x= y; [[fallthrough]];
  case 3: z= x * y; break;
  default: z= x / y;
}
```

Also added in C++17 is the ability to initialize a variable in the switch-statement in the same way as in if.

### 1.4.4 Loops

C++20 We can initialize arrays in the range-based loop.

```c++
for (int primes[]= {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}; int i : primes)
    std::cout ≪ i ≪ " ";
```

**Do not use goto! Never! Ever!**  

Writing software without goto is called *Structured Programming*. However, the term is rarely used nowadays since this is taken for granted in high-quality software.
